General TODOs:
- I mistakenly used `dataInput.readShort()` and 'dataInput.readByte()' in various places.
  All of these should be changed to `dataInput.readUnsignedShort()` and `dataUnsignedByte()`, respectively.
  Also change data types from 'short' and 'byte' to 'int'.

  (Not super critical; fixing this only fixes *very* rare cases)

- Get rid of the 'descriptor' fields in JavaField and JavaMethod.
  - When parsing a .class file, the descriptor fields should be broken to some more intuitive type
  - When compiling, do the same ^ but in reverse.

- Implement JavaClass
  - JavaClass should be a pretty programmer-friendly class (unlike JavaClassHeader and everything in the 'constants' package).
  - The JavaClass, when compiling, is responsible for creating the JavaClassHeader which is actually compiled.
    The programmer shouldn't have to ever do anything but possibly read from JavaClassHeader
